# Supervised Learning with Neural Networks

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output. 

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. 

In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. 

In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. 

Here are some examples of supervised learning;

There are different types of neural network, for example Convolution Neural Network (CNN) used often for image application and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used for one-dimensional sequence data such as translating English to Chinses or a temporal component such as text transcript. As for the autonomous driving, it is a hybrid neural network architecture.

## Structured vs Unstructured Data
Structured data refers to things that has a defined meaning such as price, age whereas unstructured data refers to thing like pixel, raw audio, text.
